# WP4T43-04 Adaptive Time-Triggered Network-on-Chip (ATTNoC)


## Description

ATTNoC is an extension of Network-on-Chip, used to interconnect multiple processing elements within SoC, equipped with Adaptive time-triggered features. Time-Triggered communication provides temporal guarantees within NoC and enables the NoC to switch between schedules whenever a context event occurs.  

The ATTNoC is an IP that can be used in the Programmable Logic of an FPGA.
The ATTNoC used source based routing, Mesh topology, wormhole routing, QoS (Best Effort, Time-Triggered, Rate Constraint)

## Objectives
The main objectives of the ATTNoC is to provides safety services by providing  :
* Determinisitc communication
* Adaptability features, allow the ATTNoC to switch schedules when context event occurs (such permanent faillures within a NoC)
* Seamless redundancy mechanism within NoC.

## Prerequisites

ATTNoC requires:
* Xilix Vitis version 2021.x
* Xilinx Vivado suite version 2021.x
